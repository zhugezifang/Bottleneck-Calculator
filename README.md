# What is the PC Bottleneck Calculator?

A PC bottleneck Calculator is a point of congestion in a system that occurs when workloads arrive at a given point more quickly than that point can handle them. This creates a delay and slows down the overall process, much like the narrowing of a bottle necks the flow of its contents. Bottlenecks can occur in various contexts, such as manufacturing, computing, and project management.

By identifying and addressing bottlenecks, systems can operate more efficiently and effectively.
